Just a test repository.

Hello People,

I'm new in the world of Git. I started some projects with Subversion or Team Foundation Server before
but never was using Git in my life. So cause of this fact I am a bit excited about the new experience
with Git. I really hope that Git pushes my motivation to start and develope new Software Projects.

Greetings,
Hakan aka Kizane28
